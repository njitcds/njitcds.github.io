## 🧠 **Deep Dive: What Each Model Delivers**

### ✅ **[Apple iPad (11‑inch)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad/128gb-pink-wifi)**

**Who it’s for:** Most common office use, presentations, video calls, email, PDFs, lightweight multitasking.

**Pros**

* **Best value for general tasks** — handles web, docs, email, Zoom/Teams without complaining.
* Large 11″ screen makes reading and multitasking nicer than smaller tablets.
* Cheapest of the three, leaving budget for cases or keyboards.
* Great battery and good camera for virtual advising.

**Cons**

* Doesn’t support Apple Intelligence features that the other two do.
* Not as powerful as the Air or the mini’s A17 Pro chip.
